# Project instructions #

Your task is to create a simple phone book application with CRUD operations. You must use Angular. For the back-end, please use C#, WebApi and Sql Server. Whilst Harbour Assist uses ServiceStack for REST, WebApi is more common so more applicable for this code test.

Your application should provide a form where you can enter in first name, last name, and phone number. You should then be able to perform 4 basic operations: create new entries in your database, read the entries, update entries by editing any of the properties, and delete the entries.

There is a script that you need to run in SQL Management Studio that will create the db along with a couple of Phone Book Entries - phonebook-db.sql

We have added the db context and the controller for you, along with the angular page. You may need to update the connection string PhoneBookContext.cs file.

## Running the solution

Building and running the Visual Studio solution should automatically: build the Angular UI, open a browser window, then redirect you to the Angular application.

Good luck!
